# Thyroid Malignancy Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a thyroid nodule is **benign or malignant** using clinical and ultrasound data. It explores multiple models and techniques to enhance prediction accuracy and model explainability.

## Models Used

- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**
- **Soft Voting Ensemble**

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **XGBoost**
- **SHAP** for explainable AI
- **imbalanced-learn** (SMOTE)
- **MySQL** for data storage
- **GitHub** for version control

---

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Class imbalance handling using **SMOTE**
- Model performance evaluation (ROC AUC, F1-score, etc.)
- Feature importance with **SHAP** and **permutation importance**
- Ensemble model for improved accuracy
- Complete code, output, and documentation included

---

## Results

- The ensemble model demonstrated robust performance across key metrics.
- SHAP visualizations revealed meaningful feature contributions to predictions.
